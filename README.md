🚀 Deployment

Docker Deployment

Create Dockerfile:

Build and run:

Production Configuration

For production deployment:

Database: Use managed PostgreSQL service (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, etc.)

Security: Use strong JWT secrets and HTTPS

Monitoring: Enable Spring Boot Actuator endpoints

Logging: Configure proper logging levels

🔒 Security Features

JWT Authentication: Stateless authentication with HTTP-only cookies

Password Encryption: BCrypt password hashing

CORS Protection: Configured for specific origins

Input Validation: Comprehensive request validation

SQL Injection Protection: JPA/Hibernate parameterized queries

�� Monitoring & Health Checks

Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (if enabled):

/actuator/health - Application health status

/actuator/info - Application information

/actuator/metrics - Application metrics

🤝 Frontend Integration

This backend is designed to work with the Fuel Pass Frontend:

API Base URL: http://localhost:8080

Authentication: JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies

CORS: Configured for frontend domains

Error Handling: Consistent error response format

�� Troubleshooting

Common Issues

Database Connection Error

Verify PostgreSQL is running

Check database credentials in application.yml

Ensure database exists

JWT Token Issues

Verify JWT secret is configured

Check token expiration settings

Ensure proper cookie handling

CORS Errors

Verify frontend URL in CORS configuration

Check if credentials are included in requests
